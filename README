Code for a site that integrates RefineryCMS (pages and user management) with Forem (forums).

To use:

* edit config/app.rb to include your domain and application name
* 'mina setup' to create empty folders on remote server
* configure nginx or apache on remote server to point to /var/www/app_name/current folder
* configure nginx or apache to proxy to unicorn server that runs this app.
* 'mina deploy' to deploy the app to remote server
* configure RefineryCMS as needed (you'll be asked to create an admin user)
* congratulations! users can now register and start using the forums after confirming their emails and getting admin approval in RefineryCMS users management.
